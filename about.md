Welcome,

My name is Cristian Stroparo and I am a DevOps Engineer with 10+ years software engineering experience. I am very fond of technology and its advancements and as such I enjoy keeping up  and applying the best workflow models for each line of work while keeping it lean!

I do deliberate practice as much as I can which made me a technical guru wherever I worked - you can confirm this by reading the recommendations on [my LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/stroparo).

## I am a heavy user of:

* Linux (strictly speaking: "GNU/Linux distributions")
* Shell scripting: Bash, Ksh, Zsh and a myriad of GNU tools such as awk, sed etcetera
* Newer platforms such as Python and Ruby, for automation
* Current industry tooling including Chef, Git, Jenkins etcetera
* Regular Expressions
* Templating: code editor snippets, Kubernetes/OpenShift templates etcetera, as much as possible to save time ("make the common case fast")
* Web technologies: [my portfolio](https://codepen.io/stroparo/full/qmLOYj/), visuals coded by myself using the slim template language and the bootstrap responsive grid library

## Recent accomplishments:

* CI/CD automation of an OpenShift process launched by Jenkins to promote applications by image pulling. (HR readers: OpenShift is Red Hat's container orchestrator offering made on top of Kubernetes which is authored by Google and is the reference, state-of-the-art container orchestration platform.)

* On September, 2017 I switched jobs and joined an international project for a major financial corporation doing Chef automation

* Undertaking Docker and Kubernetes courses to keep up with it during my current experience doing Chef automation

## Current skill honing:

I am preparing for taking industry standard certification exams like:

* AWS Technical Pro accreditation
* Chef automation
* Red Hat Certified System Administrator certificate
* Following up containerized application adoption in the industry
* [freeCodeCamp fullstack development course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/stroparo) (paused)

## Previous experience:

Before DevOps I used to be an Oracle consultant in the field of Planning & Optimization, mostly as support team lead and also tech lead in a few projects.

## Willing to relocate?

I am willing to relocate. I will need visa sponsorship for most countries outside of South America.

### Contact me

I will be glad to share any other information. Just ask me.
