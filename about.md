My name is Cristian Stroparo and I am a DevOps Engineer with 10+ years software engineering experience.

I am very fond of technology and its advancements and as such I enjoy keeping up  and applying the best workflow models for each line of work while keeping it lean!

I do deliberate practice as much as I can which made me a technical guru wherever I worked - you can confirm this by reading the recommendations on [my LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/stroparo).

## Recent accomplishments

* CI/CD automation of an OpenShift process launched by Jenkins to promote applications by image pulling. (HR readers: OpenShift is Red Hat's container orchestrator offering made on top of Kubernetes which is authored by Google and is the reference, state-of-the-art container orchestration platform.)

* On September, 2017 I switched jobs and joined an international project for a major financial corporation working on Chef automation and Jenkins Pipelines

* [Portfolio](https://codepen.io/stroparo/full/qmLOYj/) visuals to showcase some of my side projects, coded by myself using the slim template syntax and the Bootstrap responsive grid library
